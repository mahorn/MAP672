    <h2>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h2>
    
    <p>Zook et al. (2015) discuss the idea of a mapmaker by compartmentalizing the mapmaker into one of three categories: Cartographer, Coder, and Critic.  Personally, under this theme, I identify myself best as a cartographer.  I am not a cartographer by the definition of the word, but identify as such because of my background and interest in art (painting) and my attention to detail (I like to make a good and aesthetically pleasing map).</p>

    <p>Because I appreciate the artistic aspect of making maps, I can secondarily identify with the Critic.  A keen eye allows me to look at a map and start asking questions, initially about the presentation, but then about the content.  According to this philosophical approach, I need to set out as a priority in my mapping career, because I tend to be more of a Cartographer, a focus on becoming a Coder and improving as a critic.Not being a Coder in the digital era is like being “obsolete” in the mapping world. Technology and mapping, definitely go hand and hand.</p>

    <p>On New Year's day 2016, The Guardian published an article titled, "Poachers using science papers to target newly discovered species."  This article discusses how some academic journals have begun to withhold geographic locations of newly discovered species because of the recent discovery that poachers are using scientific articles as source to collect unknown herpetological species.  When discovering or describing a new species, scientists are not required to disclose GPS coordinates, but many do provide this information "as an act of empirical completion."  Back to topic, map or be mapped . . . Sometimes, mapmakers need to make a judgement call of whether or not to create a map by reviewing either how sensitive the subject matter may be, or what consequences may result from creating a 'simple' map.</p>
